Typography
- Heading sizes: large banner ~text-4xl to text-[50px] (use responsive sizes if needed).
- Body / button: text-xl for material items to make them easy to tap/click.

Spacing and layout
- Sidebar width: w-64
- Page padding: main uses p-8 to p-10 depending on page breathing room.
- Card radius: use rounded-2xl -> rounded-3xl for panels and large interactive elements.

Accessibility notes
- Ensure sufficient contrast for text on light pills (use text-black on teal-100 variants).
- Provide focus outlines for interactive elements using ring utilities.

How to use
- Copy the token classes as-is into your HTML elements.
- Prefer using the gradient classes for primary accents and pill backgrounds for contrast.
- If using background artwork, prefer the frosted glass sidebar variant to reveal the art while keeping legible controls.
